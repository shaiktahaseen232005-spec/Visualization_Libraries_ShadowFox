# Visualization_Libraries_ShadowFox
succesfully completed the Beginners task of DS intern.The task involved exploring and documenting different data visualization libraries(Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). I worked on multiple graps like Line, Bar, Scatter, Pie, and Heatmap. This task gave me a strong foundation in data visualization, which is an essential skill for any Data Scientist.
